**Key Components:**
- **ARM Cortex-A9 Cores:** Run game logic, handle input, and manage complex tasks like AI and physics.
- **Programmable Logic (PL):** Accelerates graphics rendering, potentially handles sprite blitting, collision detection, and other parallelizable tasks.
- **Peripherals:** Video and audio output, user input, networking for multiplayer features, and storage for assets and save data.
